# 🔴⚫ Red-Black Tree in C

A complete implementation of a **Red-Black Tree** data structure in **C language**, featuring insertion, deletion, searching, and tree visualization with color and indentation.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how a **self-balancing binary search tree** maintains balance through color changes and rotations after every insertion or deletion.

Developed as part of **Data Structures practice at Emertxe Institute**.
